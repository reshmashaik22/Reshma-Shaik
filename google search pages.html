<p>
As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>machine learning</a> machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.</a>

<a href=https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence><h2>Why is artificial intelligence important?</h2></a>
<p>
AI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively used in business to automate tasks done by humans, including customer service work, lead generation, fraud detection and quality control. In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks much better than humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks, such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors. Because of the massive data sets it can process, AI can also give enterprises insights into their operations they might not have been aware of. The rapidly expanding population of generative AI tools will be important in fields ranging from education and marketing to product design.

<a href=https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence><h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence?</h2></a>
<p>
<B>Advantages of AI</b><br>
<b>The following are some advantages of AI</B>.<br>
1)Good at detail-oriented jobs. AI has proven to be just as good, if not better than doctors at diagnosing certain cancers, including breast cancer and melanoma.<br>
2)Reduced time for data-heavy tasks. AI is widely used in data-heavy industries, including banking and securities, pharma and insurance, to reduce the time it takes to analyze big data sets. Financial services, for example, routinely use AI to process loan applications and detect fraud.<br>
Saves labor and increases productivity. An example here is the use of warehouse automation, which grew during the pandemic and is expected to increase with the integration of AI and machine learning.<br>
3)Delivers consistent results. The best AI translation tools deliver high levels of consistency, offering even small businesses the ability to reach customers in their native language.
Can improve customer satisfaction through personalization. AI can personalize content, messaging, ads, recommendations and websites to individual customers.<br>
4)AI-powered virtual agents are always available. AI programs do not need to sleep or take breaks, providing 24/7 service.<br>

<b>Disadvantages of AI</b><br>
<b>The following are some disadvantages of AI.</b><br>
1)Expensive.<br>
2)Requires deep technical expertise.<br>
3)Limited supply of qualified workers to build AI tools.<br>
4)Reflects the biases of its training data, at scale.<br>
5)Lack of ability to generalize from one task to another.<br>
6)Eliminates human jobs, increasing unemployment rates.<br>
<a href=https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence><h2>What is AI in transportation?</h2></a>
<p>In addition to AI's fundamental role in operating autonomous vehicles, AI technologies are used in transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays, and make ocean shipping safer and more efficient. In supply chains, AI is replacing traditional methods of forecasting demand and predicting disruptions, a trend accelerated by COVID-19 when many companies were caught off guard by the effects of a global pandemic on the supply and demand of goods.</P>
